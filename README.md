# Flip Five

This is a logic puzzle in which you have a square grid of 3x3 cells. Each cell is
initially either white or black. When you click on a square it flips, or toggles, the color of
that square and the colors of its four immediate north, south, east and west neighbors
that exist (they donâ€™t exist if they would be outside the grid).The problem is to find the
minimum number of cell clicks to transform a grid of all white cells into the input grid
(which is always possible). You cannot rotate the grid.
